🪝[In-Depth-I.D.] 
- The motivation for this project was to create a Full Stack application using MongoDB and React as our main programs to generate a resume PDF that can be used to Enhance A Users Resume.
- Reason for building this application is to showcase how we are capable to use MERN stack and an open AI library.
- We learned how to use MongoDB and change routes to resolvers/TypeDefs. Also being able to become more comfortable in Utalization of the MERN Stack structure. 

-------------------------------------------------------
